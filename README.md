This repository shows my first server. In order to put this server together
I used the Sinatra gem along with a gem bundle. My server file is written in a ruby file that I composed in Atom text editor. With the Atom editor, I also composed the accompanying Gemfile, Procfile, and static directory which includes a hello.txt file.
